    <h1>The Green Line’s Breaking Point: What September Reveals About Boston’s Transit Failures</h1>

            <p>According to data from the MBTA about gated entries, in September 2024, over 1.2 million passengers entered gated Green Line stations, a surge driven by returning students and a revitalized post-pandemic city.</p>

        <div class="text-box">
            <p>A gated entry is recorded when a passenger taps their card or pays a fare at an underground station. But these numbers tell only part of the story. Above-ground stops, particularly on the B, C, and E Lines, rely on onboard fare collection, meaning untapped entries aren’t counted, bringing the number to well over 1.2 million.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the MBTA’s gated entry data removes an estimated number of riders who transfer to the Red Line at Park Street, the Blue Line at Government Center, and other intersecting lines. This filtering is meant to clarify Green Line-specific ridership, but it also risks underestimating the true load on the system.</p>

            <p>Yet, despite predictable increases in ridership, the Green Line operated with near-identical train frequencies to quieter summer months. Platforms overflowed at rush hour, trains arrived late, and passengers squeezed onto trains like sardines.</p>

            <p>September, with its unique mix of students returning and professionals back from summer, is Boston’s public transit stress test. For the Green Line, the numbers show that it failed—leaving riders waiting on platforms, crowding onto already-packed trains, and questioning whether the country’s oldest transit system can keep up with the modern city it needs to serve.</p>
